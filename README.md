The objective of the study was to investigate the persistent molecular changes induced by chronic estrogen loss which underlies its lasting effect on the brain physiology, thereby making itself a female sex-biased risk factor for age-related dementia. Complementary transcriptomic, metabolomic, and pharmacological approaches were employed to elucidate the effect of estrogen signaling loss in vivo and in vitro. The effect of the accelerated ovarian failure-induced menopause model on animal behavior, metabolic reprogramming changes, neuronal integrity, and functions were evaluated in wildtype, as well as forebrain neuron-specific estrogen-related receptor-alpha (Esrra/ERRα) knockdown mice. Human studies entailed re-assessment of the ROSMAP brain tissue single nuclei RNA-sequencing dataset, bulk transcriptomics, and metabolomics datasets, as well as immunostaining analyses from patients diagnosed with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) and non-dementia subjects (ND).
