The objective of the study was to investigate the persistent molecular changes induced by chronic estrogen loss which underlies its lasting effect on the brain physiology, thereby making itself a female sex-biased risk factor for age-related dementia. Complementary transcriptomic, metabolomic and pharmacological approaches were employed to elucidate the effect of estrogen signalling loss in vivo and in vivo. The effect of accelerated ovarian failure-induced menopause model on animal behaviour, metabolic reprogramming changes, neuronal integrity and functions were evaluated in wildtype, as well as forebrain neuron-specific estrogen related receptor-alpha (Esrra/ERRα) knockdown mice. Human studies entailed re-assessment of the ROSMAP brain tissue single nuclei RNA-sequencing dataset, bulk transcriptomics and metabolomics datasets, as well as immunostaining analyses from patients diagnosed with late onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) and non-dementia subjects (ND).
